### Front-End
Front-End adapted from the [Chats-With-Rosie project](https://github.com/Chats-With-Rosie/rosie-front-end)


### Playing with the Rosie Character Definition through Oogabooga Text Generation WebUI
Follow the instructions to install and run the Text Generation WebUI found [here](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui). Follow the instructions in the linked repository to find and set up a suitable language model from the HuggingFace repository.


Copy the Rosie character files from this repo's `characters` folder into the WebUI's `characters` folder. If you are already running the WebUI, simply refresh the characters and you will be able to load the Rosie character from there.
